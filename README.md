# Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities using machine learning models applied to customer profiles and transaction data.
## Data Integration
### Multiple Datasets: The project integrates various datasets, including customer profiles, account activities, fraud indicators, suspicious activities, merchant information, transaction amounts, and transaction metadata.
Data Merging: Merging of customer data with account and suspicious activity records to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
## Data Analysis
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis of customer behaviors, transaction patterns, and potential fraud indicators.
### Feature Engineering: Creation of new features based on existing data to improve model accuracy.
## Visualization
### Data Visualization: Visual representations using seaborn and matplotlib to identify trends and anomalies in transaction data.
## Machine Learning
### Random Forest Classifier: Implementation of RandomForestClassifier to predict fraudulent activities.
### Model Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics to ensure reliable fraud detection.
